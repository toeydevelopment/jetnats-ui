# STAY TUNED ! UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Disclaimer
this project i made because i want to slove my painpoint that i found when using nats and jetstream without ui, and i want to improve and learn rust-language that why i chose rust-lang as server language.

Actually jetnats-server is unnecessary because you can connect nats in frontend directly, the reason that jetnats-server existed because security and i want to learn rust-lang !

If anything goes wrong or you found something that shouldn't happen or do please feel free to contact me or open an issue.
